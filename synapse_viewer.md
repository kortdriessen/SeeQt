For the synapse viewer, we want to take the base functionality of the sleepscore viewer, but add a few things: first, I simply want a way to load a number of timeseries (just as in the sleepscore script), but I want the entire timecourse of the whole recording to load. Rather than being able to click and drag for annotation, I want to be able to click and drag in order to zoom in - in other words, I am viewing between t=0 and t=3600s, I should be able to click and drag between t=500-600s and have my data view change to show me between 500-600s. All other functionality such as video, etc. should stay as similar as possible for now.
