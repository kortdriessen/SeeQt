I want to create a basic application for taking notes and annotating images, videos, and text files associated with my experiments - it is a gui and and application, but think of it like a digital "lab notebook" that I can use to view and annotate information about my experiments. 
A basic screenshot of what this should look like can be found by looking at the attached image. Please note: the design particulars in that screenshot are NOT to be taken literally, and not to be duplicated exactly, they are just for display. For example, the sections should not simply be gray boxes on a white background, there should not be red text headers, etc. This screenshot's only purpose is to provide a rough sense of what I am going for - but you have full authority to make design and functionality decisions to make the application work well and look good. I think it may be possible to implement this type of application in python using PySide6 and associated libraries, but I will again leave it up to you as to the best implementation method. 

The main purpose of the lab notebook gui is to load a directory of data associated with a particular experimental acquisition, and allow me to view and/or edit it. As such, the whole thing should work off of a given file structure. When starting the software, the user selects a single directory. From here, there will be top-level subdirectories (the 'Subject-1' and 'Subject-2' in my example). Those directories will have a number of sub-directories (e.g. the 'exp' and 'loc' levels in my example) until you get to the materials directory, which will always contain a materials.txt file. The things inside the materials directory should not be shown on the left (hideable) sidebar... here, the user should be able to see the full expanded directory structure, and then be able to select one of the terminal materials directories (my example shows that the user selected subject-1, exp_1, loc_B, acq_2, which is indicated to the user via the blue boxes). 

Once a materials directory is selected, it can be assumed that the following things will usually be present, and should be displayed in their own pane or section of the main view as follows:

1. a 'canvas' directory, which will contain some number of .png images (most often 2). The images in this folder should be displayed in the 'Image Canvas View'. Critically, the user must be able to draw on these images using the mouse (or wacom tablet, etc.), and the drawn annotations must save properly so that they always appear. When drawing annotations, the user should be able to press ctrl-Z and undo the last thing they drew. The user should be able to quickly switch the pen color between ~6 quick presets (red, blue, yellow, green, pink, orange), and there should be a slider to set stroke width in pixels with some sensible default. The user should be able to pan and zoom each image in the canvas view independently (within its container), and there should be a shortcut to make the active image full-screen (where it can still be drawn on, panned, zoomed).
2. a metadata.csv file, which will be a basic table that should be displayed in the 'MetaData view'. Not many requirements here, just make the display of the table clear, and allow the user some flexibility in the settings of how it is displayed.
3. a notes.md file, which should be displayed in the notes view. The user should be able to press a shortcut or button to enter edit mode, where they can edit the raw notes.md file directly within the notes view.
4. an 'attachments' directory, which may contain a number of files such as images or videos. The user should be able to view everything in the attachments directory, click any one of them, and view the file in the optimal way for that file (we can start with .png or .mp4 at the very least).

Please create this application. Make it easy to use and give the user as much flexibility as possible in the ability to choose or customize settings, the layout/view, hotkeys, etc. The details of the implementation are up to you, but it must run on windows, and it would be very beneficial if it could run on mac as well.
